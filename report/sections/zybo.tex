\section{Embedded Design}\label{sec:Embedded_Design}
\label{sec:emb}
An embedded system is needed to handle a wide range of task. 
It is a requirement for the project that the Zybo board should be used as the embedded system in the project.
The Zybo board features a Zynq Z-7010 chip from Xilinx, which has an integrated dual-core ARM Cortex-A9 processor and a Xilinx 7-series field programmable gate array (FPGA).
The Zybo board itself consists, among other, of several buttons, switches, LEDs and connections for USB, Ethernet, HDMI and several PMOD connectors. 
Throughout the remainder of the report the FPGA part will be referred to as the Programmable Logic (PL) and the ARM processor as the Processing System (PS). 


\subsection{Functionality}
An analysis of the complete system yielded the functionalities listed below for the Zybo board. 

\begin{itemize}
\item Digital inputs and outputs
\item Generating PWM
\item Measuring voltage output from LEM sensors and torque pedal
\item UART communication with external PC
\item Control algorithms for dq-control
\item Read position from encoder
\item SPI communication as master
\end{itemize}

As can be seen on the list there are multiple tasks that needs to be handled. 
Optimally, these tasks should be run at different speeds.
For instance, the PWM switching frequency should be 20\si{\kilo\hertz} as described in section \ref{sec:inverter}.
As this is quite fast it should be handled in PL. 
The rest can be handled in PS.
In order to more easily run tasks at different frequencies it was chosen to use khaOS, a Run To Complete Scheduler (RTCS) system made by Karsten Holm Andersen.
Using an RTCS simplifies scheduling tasks to run at different frequencies.

As an RTCS has no way to preempt tasks it leaves the responsibility of preserving real time performance of the system to the programmer.
khaOS was chosen before other RTCS as the group had prior knowledge about the system from an Embedded Systems course.

\subsection{Architecture}
The software functionalities are grouped into tasks based on functionality and desired frequency.
A task diagram of the complete system on the Zybo can be seen in figure \ref{fig:task_diagram}.

  \label{fig:task_diagram}
\end{figure}

As can be seen, various signals are coming from the outside world through the PL into the PS.
All tasks, IP cores and I/O peripherals will be described in the coming sections.

\subsubsection{Three phase PWM generator}
The PWM generator is placed in the PL and is developed using Xilinx System Generator in Matlab Simulink.
The generator is made to have adjustable frequency and duty cycle.
It was chosen to generate center aligned PWM as this introduces less harmonic distortion than edge aligned PWM \cite{power_switching_converters}. 
Furthermore center aligned PWM has the benefit of producing symmetrical PWM.
Symmetrical PWM has a well defined midpoint where the current can be sampled correctly. \todo[inline]{Thomas: Do you ever touch on why it is difficult to sample correctly?}
The high limit for the counter can be calculated for a given frequency, $f$, by the following:
$$H = L + \frac{f_{Zybo}}{f\cdot 2}$$
Where H is the high limit, L is the low limit and $f_{zybo}$ is the Zybo clock frequency.
The PWM counter system can be seen in figure \ref{fig:pwm_counter}.
The counter block will count up or down depending on the input. 
The output from the counter value will go into to two compare blocks along with the high and low limits.
The compare blocks will produce a high signal when the counter value is equal either the high or low limit.
These signals are then fed to an m-code block which contains a simple state machine which determines the direction of the counter.
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{graphics/counter}
	\caption[Block diagram of counter in PWM generator.]{Simulink block diagram of the counter in the PWM generator.}
	\label{fig:pwm_counter}
\end{figure}
The counter out signal can be seen in figure \ref{fig:pwm_graph}.
This signal is then fed into the PWM generator shown in figure \ref{fig:pwm}. 
The duty cycle is given to the PWM generator as data type u32, an integer type.
Therefore the dutycycle is given in a range of 0 to 1000, giving a resolution of 0.1\%.
The switching limit is the value, where when the counter value equals, switches the polarity of the PWM output.
The switching limit is calculated from the following:
$$l = (1 - \frac{d}{1000}) \cdot r$$
Where l is the switching limit, d is the dutycycle in the range 0 - 1000 and r is the counter range.
A register will then make sure that the switching limit is only applied when the counter is lowest.
This is important as otherwise the dutycycle may be corrupted by misaligning the PWM.
The compare block will make the PWM signal by comparing the switcing limit to the counter value.
The counter signal and output of the PWM generator can be seen in figure \ref{fig:pwm_graph}.
As the PWM generator should be able to do three independent PWM signal there are three of the systems shown in figure \ref{fig:pwm}, one for each phase.

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{graphics/pwm_plot}
		\caption{Counter and PWM signal.}
		\label{fig:pwm_graph}
	\end{center}
\end{figure}


\subsubsection{Interface task}
The interface task reads external signals, outputs digital signals and controls the other tasks.
This includes ensuring that the state of the enable variable, read by the controller and the PWM task, is correct.
The basic functionality of the interface task can be seen in the flowchart of figure \ref{fig:interface}.

%\begin{figure}[!h]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{graphics/interface_task}
%	\caption[Block diagram of PWM generator.]{Simulink block diagram of the counter in the PWM generator.}
%	\label{fig:interface}
%\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includestandalone[width=0.5\textwidth]{graphics/interface_flow}
	\caption[Interface task.]{Flow chart illustrating the basic functionality of the interface task.}
	\label{fig:interface}
\end{figure}

At startup the interface task switches on the inrush relay for a certain time.
Afterwards the main relay is switched on and the inrush relay is switched off after some time to ensure that the main relay is conducting.
Then the task will read all signals from the digital board and, if \texttt{EN\_GATE} is high, the global enable variable will be set high.
If \texttt{EN\_GATE} is low, indicating a fault, the task will change the enable variable to low.
Alongside the functionality shown in figure \ref{fig:interface}, the interface will act as master for the two UART tasks.
This enables the setting of values within the system as well as potentially reading the current status of the system.
All communication through the UART interface is done through the \texttt{rx\_buffer} and \texttt{tx\_buffer} arrays shown in listing \ref{lis:uartvars}.
Currently three parameters can be set within the system:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \texttt{kp/ki}: These are the values of the PI controller used.
	\item \texttt{qmax}: The limit of the current that the controller is allowed to set as reference. 
\end{itemize}
Setting any of the above is done by:
\begin{center}
\texttt{set <parameter> <value>}
\end{center}
As can be seen in listing \ref{lis:cutcommand} the command is split into parts using \texttt{strtok()}.
This is a non-reentrant function that will return all the characters until the first appearance of delimiter.
Every consecutive call to the function with \texttt{NULL} as the first parameter will continue the search through the same array.
With the command split into tokens it is parsed using a simple if-structure, comparing each argument in the command using \texttt{strcmp()} until a value can be set.

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,style=customCpp, caption={Something clever!.THOMASSSS!}, label=lis:cutcommand, escapeinside={(*@}{@*)}]
if(rx_flag)
{
  char* cmd = strtok(rx_buffer, DELIMITER);
  char* var = strtok(NULL, DELIMITER);
  char* val = strtok(NULL, DELIMITER);
  
  if(!strcmp(cmd,"set"))
  {
    if(!strcmp(var,"kp"))
    {
      scanf(val, "%f", &kp);
      sprintf(tx_buffer, "kp was set: %f", kp);
      tx_flag = true;
      tx_tail = strlen(tx_buffer);
    }
  	
(*@\makebox[.25\linewidth][c]{$\smash{\vdots}$}@*)
  
  }
  rx_flag = false;
  rx_tail = 0x00;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Once the value is set a message is returned to the user, informing of the successful setting.
\texttt{rx\_flag} is cleared and the buffer is emptied by setting \texttt{rx\_tail} to zero.
The system is made with expandability in mind, currently only a \texttt{set} command is implemented.
This could easily be extended to a \texttt{read} or perhaps a \texttt{shutdown} command.

\subsubsection{Controller task}
\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
	\includestandalone[width=0.9\textwidth]{graphics/tikz/Block_diagram1tikz}
%		\includegr%aphics[width=0.9\linewidth,trim=3cm 15cm 0 2cm]{graphics/controller_tasktikz}
	\caption[Block diagram of controller task.]{Block diagram showing the functionality of the controller task.}
	\label{fig:controller_task}
\end{figure}

The basic functionality of the controller task can be seen in figure \ref{fig:controller_task}.
The task polls data from the ADC in order to get the raw data for the phase currents $I_a$, $I_b$ and the torque pedal.
The raw data from the ADC is then calculated into voltages and the two currents are calculated by:

\begin{equation}
	 I = \frac{V_{measured}}{R_m} \cdot NS
\end{equation}

$I_c$ is calculated based on the assumption that the three currents form a balanced three phase system.
The resistance of the torque pedal potentiometer is calculated from the measured voltage and equation \ref{eq:pedal_back_calc}.

$I_a$, $I_b$, $I_c$ and $\theta$ are then used to perform a Clarke Park transformation and obtaining the values of $I_d$ and $I_q$. 
$I_d$ and $I_q$ should be controlled towards a set point by two separate controllers.
The point for $I_d$ is 0 as will be explained in section  \ref{sec:controller_design}. 
The point, $q_{set}$, for $I_q$ should be related to the maximum allowed current, $q_{max}$, and the position of the torque pedal in percent, $pedal_\%$:
\begin{equation}
	q_{set} = pedal_\% \cdot q_{max}
\end{equation}
It was chosen to use two PI controllers as will be described in section \ref{sec:controller_design}.
The code for one of the controllers can be seen in listing \ref{lis:controller_code}.
As can been seen in line 2 trapezoidal integration is used to perform the integration. 
Lines 4-8 performs anti-windup and lines 9-14 calculates the output if enable is high and performs integrator reset if low.

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,style=customCpp, caption={[C code constituting a PI controller.]C code constituting a PI controller with trapezoidal integration, anti windup and integrator reset.}, label=lis:controller_code]
d_error = d_set - I_d_measured;
d_integral = d_integral + (d_previous_error + d_error)*0.5*dt;

if(d_integral > MAX_TOTAL_OUTPUT){
	d_integral = MAX_TOTAL_OUTPUT;
}else if (d_integral < -MAX_TOTAL_OUTPUT){
	d_integral = -MAX_TOTAL_OUTPUT;
}
if(enable){
	d_output = kp * d_error + ki * d_integral;
}else{
	d_output = 0;
	d_integral = 0;
}
d_previous_error = d_error;

\end{lstlisting}
Afterwards \texttt{d\_output} and \texttt{q\_output} are 
Afterwards the output values are downscaled if they exceed the maximum limits.
The code for downscaling can be seen in \ref{lis:saturation}.

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,style=customCpp, caption={[C code for downscaling.]C code for detecting and downscaling output values that exceed the maximum limits.}, label=lis:saturation]
total_output_magnitude = sqrt(d_output*d_output + q_output*q_output);

if(total_output_magnitude > MAX_TOTAL_OUTPUT){
	d_output = (d_output* MAX_TOTAL_OUTPUT)/total_output_magnitude;
	q_output = (q_output* MAX_TOTAL_OUTPUT)/total_output_magnitude;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{PWM task}
The basic functionality of the PWM task can be seen in the block diagram of figure \ref{fig:pwm_task}.
The task needs to take the outputs from the controller task and transform it into duty cycles that can be feed to the PWM generator in the PL area of the Zybo. 
The PWM task is separate from the controller task as it might be preferable to have the two tasks run at different frequencies.
The task reads the rotor position from the encoder and access the global variables \texttt{d\_output} and \texttt{q\_output}. 
This information is used to perform inverse Clarke Park transformation.
Afterwards third harmonic injection is performed and if the values are higher or lower than the maximum bounds they are limited.
The global enable variable is checked and passed to the enable pin.


\begin{figure}[!h]

  	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{graphics/PwmTask2}
	\caption[Block diagram of PWM task.]{Block diagram showing the functionality of the PWM task.}
	\label{fig:pwm_task}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{ADC}
The Zynq chip contains a dual 12-bit, 1 Mega sample per second (MSPS) Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC) \cite{adc}.
The ADC is utilized through the XADC Wizard in Vivado. 
The ADC measures the difference between differential analog input pins $V_p$ and $V_n$.
The IP core is configured to use AXI4LITE connection, simultaneous selection, unipolar mode and event mode.
Simultaneous selection mode is used as it allows simultaneous sampling on the dual ADC. 
When using simultaneous sampling the phase relationship is preserved.
When unipolar mode is enabled the input range between $V_p$ and $V_n$ is 1 \si{\volt} and the input voltage must always be positive with respect to ground.
Setting the ADC in event mode, means that the ADC will only sample when there is a rising edge on its CONVST pin. 
The CONVST pin is connected to the top signal of the PWM generator meaning that the ADC will sample in the center of the PWM pulse.
This is done to sample the current correctly. 
Channels 6 and 14 are paired together in simultaneous mode, meaning that they will be sampled simultaneously.
These are the channels that the outputs from the two LEM sensors are connected to. 
The torque pedal signal will be routed to channel 7 which will be sampled after channel 6 and 14.
The top signal from the PWM generator will start the sampling and therefore it will also set the sampling frequency.
As the PWM frequency is 20 \si{\kilo\hertz} the ADC sampling frequency will be as well.

\subsubsection{UART RX/TX}
In order to facilitate communication between the Zybo board and a PC, a small UART connection is established.
The connection consists of two tasks, UART\_RX and UART\_TX.
They handle receiving and transmitting, respectively.
As shown in listing \ref{lis:uartvars} each of the tasks are given a buffer, a flag and a tail variable.

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,style=customCpp, caption={UART\_RX/TX buffers and variables.}, label=lis:uartvars]
char rx_buffer[0xff];
char tx_buffer[0xff];
bool rx_flag = false, tx_flag = false;
uint8_t rx_tail = 0x00, tx_tail = 0x00;
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,style=customCpp, caption={UART\_RX task.}, label=lis:uartrx]
void uart_rx_task()
{
  if (XUartPs_IsReceiveData(UART_BASEADDR))
  {
    rx_buffer[rx_tail] = XUartPs_ReadReg(UART_BASEADDR, XUARTPS_FIFO_OFFSET);
    rx_tail++;
  }
  if(rx_buffer[rx_tail-1] == '\r')
  {
    rx_flag = true;
  }
  _wait(MILLI_SEC(1));
}
\end{lstlisting}

Looking at listing \ref{lis:uartrx} the function of these in the UART\_RX task can be seen.
If there is data on the line it is pushed onto the \texttt{rx\_buffer} and \texttt{rx\_tail} is incremented.
This is to keep track of the number of characters that have been received.
Finally, if the last character received is a carriage return, the \texttt{rx\_flag} is set high.
This indicates to the interface task that a full command has been received and is ready for execution.
Listing \ref{lis:uarttx} shows the UART\_TX task.
Every time it is run it will check \texttt{tx\_flag}.
If \texttt{tx\_flag} is high, this indicates that data has been put into the \texttt{tx\_buffer}.
All \texttt{tx\_tail} characters in the buffer are transmitted character by character.
Hereafter \texttt{tx\_buffer} is "emptied" by setting \texttt{tx\_tail} to zero and \texttt{tx\_flag} is set low to indicate that transmission is complete.
\begin{lstlisting}[captionpos=b,style=customCpp, caption={UART\_TX task.}, label=lis:uarttx] 
void uart_tx_task()
{
  if(tx_flag)
  {
    uint8_t i;
    for(i = 0; i < tx_tail; i++)
    {
      xil_printf("%c",tx_buffer[i]);
    }
    tx_tail = 0x00;
    tx_flag = false;
  }
  _wait(MILLI_SEC(250));
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Encoder}
The Zybo board needs to interface the RMB28MD encoder that is mounted on the motor.
The RMB28MD is an absolute encoder with sine/cosine, SSI and incremental output. 
It was chosen to use the SSI output as an IP core capable of reading the position by SSI communication was made available by the supervisors of the group.
Reading the position through SSI yields a resolution of 8 bit per mechanical revolution. 
The physical RMB28MD encoder signals are interfaced by an IP Core.
The IP core outputs a clock to the RMB28MD chip and reads data from a data pin. 
It then makes the data available on the AXI4LITE bus, where it can be read from software by the PWM task. 

\subsection{SPI communication}

%\begin{figure}[!h]
%	\centering
%	\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/spi_timing}
%	\caption[SPI timing requirements.]{SPI timing requirements.From datasheet? How to cite?}
%	\label{fig:spi_timing}
%\end{figure}

As described earlier the Zybo board will need to set certain parameters on the DRV8301 chip using SPI communication. 
The Zynq chip has two SPI controllers in the PS area of the chip, which can be setup to communicate with external devices.
By investigation of the Zynq datasheet \cite{zynq_reference} it was found that it is not possible to configure the SPI controller to meet the requirements of the DRV8301. 
More specifically, it is not possible to configure the clock signal to go low for a minimum of 40 \si{\nano\second} \cite{DRV8301}, before Slave Select goes low. 

Two solutions are proposed to solve to this problem:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Develop a simple SPI driver in VHDL or System Generator to send the 16 bits according to the SPI requirements of the DRV8301.
	\item Use the SPI controller in PS and delay the Slave Select signal physically.
\end{enumerate}

Clearly, the correct solution to the problem is to develop an SPI driver, but due to time considarations it was decided to use the SPI controller of the Zynq.

SPI 1 on the Zynq is used as it can be ported to MIO channels 10 to 15, which can be accessed through the PMOD connectors of the Zybo board. 
The SPI controller is initialized in software and is configured to be in master mode, manual chip select mode and manual start mode by writing to the configuration register Config\_reg0.
In order to comply with the SPI specifications of the DRV8301 it was configured with the XSPIPS\_CLK\_PHASE\_1\_OPTION in order to make data valid on falling edges of the clock. 
The discharge of a capacitor is utilized to make a delay on the Slave Select signal, by putting a XX capacitor and XX resistor in series with the signal.
\todo[inline]{Thomas: Are they in series? + numbers instead of XX XX}
The transmission of \texttt{0b0001000000110000} was measured using an oscilloscope and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:spi_graph}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{graphics/spi}
	\caption[SPI transmission.]{SPI transmission of two data bytes.}
	\label{fig:spi_graph}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Task frequencies}
Table \ref{tabl:task_freq} shows the frequencies at which the task are run.
The PWM task will be run at 20 \si{\kilo\hertz} as this allows for updates of dutycycles at the same frequency as the PWM generator.
The controller task will run at 5 \si{\kilo\hertz} as will be explained in section \ref{sec:controller_design}.
The most essential functionality of the interface task is to update the enable variable. 
As the driver chip shuts down the inverter in case of an overcurrent event it is not very time critical to do so.
Therefore it was chosen to run the interface task at 1\si{\kilo\hertz}.
The UART tasks are not in any way crucial and can therefore be run at a low frequency, though it has to be fast enough for the user to feel that the system is responding, 100\si{\hertz} was chosen.

\begin{table}[]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|}
\hline
\rowcolor[HTML]{C0C0C0} 
\textbf{Task} & \textbf{Frequency} 				\\ \hline
PWM     	  & 20\si{\kilo\hertz}               \\ \hline
Controller    & 5\si{\kilo\hertz}               \\ \hline
Interface     & 1\si{\kilo\hertz}              \\ \hline
UART          & 100\si{\hertz}            		\\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Table showing the frequency of each task.}
\label{tabl:task_freq}
\end{table}

\subsection{Timing}
To ensure the real time performance of the system a timing test was performed. 
An output pin was set high when entering a task and low, when exiting the task. 
PWM, controller and interface were connected to separate pins while the two UART tasks were connected to the same pin.
The voltage on the pins were measured by an oscilloscope and the measurement can be seen in figure \ref{fig:timing}.
In the first graph the tasks are in normal operation and it can be seen that the real time performance is maintained and that there is time left for expanding the tasks.
In the lower graph, the interface task is programmed to output a string to the UART transmit task, giving extra work to both tasks.
It is seen that the real time performance is still maintained even in, what is believed to be, a worst case operation.
The delay between the PWM task and the controller task can, at time of writing, not be explained.
However, it does not interfere with the functionality of the program and will, due to time constraints, not be investigated further.
