\section{System Implementation and Testing}
This section will describe how the system was implemented and tested on both a test setup and the real go-kart setup. 

\subsection{Test Setup}
In order to test subparts of the complete system a test setup was introduced.
It consists of a permanent magnet motor of the type PM5113 with a RMB28MD encoder module mounted with a small distance to the end of the shaft.
The setup furthermore consits of a 74HCT14 level shift interface board and a ?? dual H-bridge and can be seen in figure \ref{fig:small_motor_setup}.
The setup was made and soldered by the supervisors of the project.
The full setup with H-bridge can be used to test the functionality of the Embedded System.
The motor and encoder can be used to test the full system.
