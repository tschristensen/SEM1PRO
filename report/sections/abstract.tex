\todo[]{Thomas: I rewrote this section to include our time conumdrum, also, the number of people in the class/group is irrelevant. If people have something more they think is appropriate for this section, please do not hesitate to add it.}

This report is written in partial fulfilment of the first semester of the masters programme in electrical engineering at the University of Southern Denmark.
Due to time constraints it was decided to collaborate across all the students in the class.
For this reason most of the electrical circuitry was developed by the authors of this report whereas the power electronics was mostly devised by the other group.
Regardless, all aspects of the project will be discussed throughout the report.

We would like to thank our supervisors, Karsten Holm Andersen and Jacob Lykke Pedersen for the invaluable assistance and patience they have exerted throughout the semester.
A word of thanks goes to our lecturers; Morten Nymand who has, on numerous occasions, provided assistance in the technical aspects of board layout and power electronics, and Jørgen Christian Larsen for saving countless hours of frustration with his assistance on Xilinx and all of the problems that follow.
Additionally, for helping with practical aspects of the project including layout and sourcing of components, Thanks to Jesper Nielsen.

\todo[inline]{Thomas: I disagree with the foreign language part. Never has an IEEE article had an abstract in a language different from the language of the main report. The purpose of an abstract is to give a brief overview of the objectives and results of the work enclosed in the report.}

Abstract in foreign language as is the norm. (greek or danish?)
