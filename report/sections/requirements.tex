\section{Requirements}
The project requirements have been defined by the supervisors. They are defined to utilize the given hardware, and to limit the project in scope.\newline
The requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design and implement a motor controller to replace the current Sevcon gen4 motor controller used in the SDU electric kart.

\item The new controller must use the same connection types for easy replacement of the control and driver solutions.

\item The motor controller should only be able to control the PMAC motor in forward direction.

\item The solution must use a Zynq FPGA and a self-designed 3-phase inverter to control the PMAC motor.

\item It must be possible to set and get relevant parameters through a communication interface by a computer.

\item All sensors and switches available on the kart must be interfaced and usable to their desired effect.

\item It is not allowed to change any mechanical or electrical parts on the kart, except replacing the Sevcon gen4 controller.
\end{itemize}

These requirements will be the base of the solution presented in this report.
