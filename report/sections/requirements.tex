\section{Requirements}
The project requirements have been defined by the supervisors. 

Project requirement:
\begin{itemize}
\item The solution must use a Zynq FPGA and a self‐designed 3‐phase inverter to control the PMAC motor. 

\item It should be possible to set and get relevant parameters through a communication interface by a computer. Note: It is possible to use the UART interface on the Zybo board as communication interface.    

\item It is not allowed to change any mechanical or electrical parts on the kart, except replacing the Sevcon gen4 controller
\end{itemize}
