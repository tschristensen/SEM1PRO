\section{Requirements}
The project description given by the supervisors outlines the requirements that are set for this project.
They are defined to utilize the given hardware, and to limit the project in scope.
The requirements are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Design and implement a motor controller to replace the current Sevcon gen4 \todo{Thomas: some citation or source for this controller} motor controller used in the SDU electric kart.

\item The motor controller must use the same connection types for easy replacement of the control and driver solutions.

\item The motor controller is required to be able to control the PMAC motor only in the forward direction.

\item The digital part of the control of the PMAC motor must be handled using the Zynq-7010 FPGA present on the Zybo board.

\item The design of the 3-phase inverter necessary to control the PMAC motor is part of the project

\item It must be possible to set and get relevant parameters through a communication interface by a computer.
\todo[inline]{Thomas: What is relevant parameters}
\item All sensors and switches available on the kart must be interfaced and usable to their desired effect.

\item It is not allowed to change any mechanical or electrical parts on the kart, except replacing the Sevcon gen4 controller.
\end{itemize}

These requirements will be the base of the solution presented in this report.
